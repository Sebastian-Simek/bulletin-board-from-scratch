## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"** 
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision** Need two buttons on home page. One to go to login details, one to go to create stuff page. Will need to generate divs for objects that will be drawn from database:
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?** State tracked will be is user logged in
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")**  Need first two buttons to redirect to new pages. On login new page, need form to submit and input fields for userEmail and userPassword.
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)** Will need event listeners on buttons and submit form. Will need document.createElement to display new divs. 
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?** Dom will update for new objects to be displayed. 
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)** Will need to log our inputs. 
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated? 
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
